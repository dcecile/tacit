# Tacit
_A programming language_

[![Codacy grade](https://img.shields.io/codacy/grade/9c51ed7b9a0b4c49bdfdd073a0d2b1a3.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.codacy.com/app/tacit-lang/tacit)

## Developing

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install a JDK (to run the Scala compiler) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (to download the Scala compiler and library dependencies).

### Workflow

Here are some important `sbt` commands:

- `run` (to run)
- `test` (to run all tests)
- `~testQuick` (to run only affected tests, and run them again when any source file changes)
- `bench` (to run benchmarks)
- `fmt` (to reformat all source files)

### Code style

For Scala code style, see the [Tacit wiki page](../../wiki/Scala-code-style).

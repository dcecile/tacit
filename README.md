# Tacit
_A programming language_

## Developing

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install a JDK (to run the Scala compiler) and [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (to download the Scala compiler and library dependencies).

### Workflow

Here are some important `sbt` commands:

- `run` (to run)
- `test` (to run all tests)
- `~testQuick` (to run only affected tests, and run them again when any source file changes)
- `bench` (to run benchmarks)
- `fmt` (to reformat all source files)
